                <p class="card-text padding-left-20 padded-right-20">
                  Students in our academy (and parents) always ask me, "Coach, what can I do to improve my game (or my
                  child's game)?" My first response is usually, have you been practicing the drills we did in
                  practice/training on your own time? If the answer is 'no,' then I'll quickly recap some fundamental
                  drills (targeting areas of weakness for the student asking), and try to teach them some ways they can
                  practice on their own.<br><br>
                  <i>A good coach not only tells you what to do but also shows you how to do it, a great coach will show
                    what to do and empower you to add progressions as you continue to improve.</i><br><br>
                  If the answer is 'yes,' then I'll usually show some challenging progressions that the student can work
                  towards, or direct them to useful resources.<br><br>
                  Speaking of useful resources... I have added 10 crucial game-changing basketball tips in this blog
                  post! You'll notice a lot of what you read is psychological - believe it or not, psychology of the
                  game is just as, if not more important than your physical ability when it comes to basketball!(We'll
                  discuss sport psychology in more detail in a future post.)In the meantime, here are your 10 tips
                  courtesy of ZOR Basketball Academy. Make sure you read through all of them and subscribe to our
                  mailing list to receive your own copy. <br><br></p>

                  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Game-day Mantra Should Be, “SHOOT! DON’T THINK”</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">You should focus your shooting mechanics during practice NOT during
                  games. During practice you should hone in on your form, and other shooting skills. Once you have honed
                  in on these skills, your muscle memory slowly start to take over, and you will remove overthinking
                  about shooting. Remember: Practice and perfect your form for shots during practice, not games.</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STOP BEING SHOOK!</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Failure is not fatal! Do not be afraid of failing! Michael Jordan once
                  said, “I've never been afraid to fail." Did you know professional basketball players miss more than
                  half of the time? Do not be scared of missing your shots. The energy put into becoming scared, will
                  cause you to tense up and that will affect your game performance.</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BE IN THE ZONE</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Stay focused and stay determined!<br><br>Have you been in the zone
                  before? When all of your shots were made with no effort and being on the court was just plain
                  fun.<br><br>When you are in The Zone everything else doesn’t matter. So, make it a priority to be in
                  the Zone when you are playing in games. Un-clutter your mind, and get into the mental space of optimal
                  focus. Prioritize items on your to-do list before your game, so you don’t need to think of it during
                  game time.</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU HAVE TO RELAX</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Relax your mind so that your body is as relaxed as much as it can
                  possibly be. Your shooting will be lethal when your mind is more relaxed.<br><br>Taking a moment to
                  relax before a game really pays off.</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COLOURED BALLS WILL HELP TO CORRECT YOUR ROTATION</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Using a coloured basketball during practice, will help improve the
                  trajectory of your shot. The coloured ball will help you see the direction of the ball and way the
                  ball rotates. Being able to see these will aid in correcting your shot pretty quickly.</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEGATIVE THOUGHTS WILL OBSTRUCT SUCCESS</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Negative thoughts will impact your game! You must actively work towards
                  eliminating negative thoughts. Once you eliminate negative, you have the ability to drastically boost
                  your shot percentage!<br><br>Here’s a trick to help eliminate those negative thoughts. Before
                  game-time whisper to yourself, “I don’t care if I make any of my shots today!” Whisper it to yourself
                  a couple times and psych yourself into believing your words. Repeat your words as you are going up for
                  your shots.<br><br>This process helps you to clear your mind of bad thoughts and relax. This tip will
                  help you from getting too down on yourself, and maintain your confidence no matter the game-time
                  situation.</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find Your Arc Optimization</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Did you know a shot with a flat 45 degree shot has 5 times more of a
                  chance of clearing the hoop than a flat 35 degree arc?! Making sure that the arc of your shot has
                  perfect degree will decrease your margin of error!</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youtube Game Footage</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Viewing the game footage of your favourite ball players over and over
                  will help you see the form of excellent shooters. You can pick up tips of how to improve your
                  confidence and form.<br><br>The pros have already perfected their technique. Watching their form will
                  give you ideas of technique to incorporate in your game. </p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoot 50 Shots Before all Games</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">Take 50 easy shots before all of your practice and games. The repetitive
                  motion of taking this amount of shots will help correct your shooting form, and increase confidence.
                  You will become better and better at these shots with every session. This is a very effective drill
                  that all of the pros do!</p>
                <h3 class="is-size-5 padding-left-20 block-text-color font-avenir-demi-bold has-line-height-30">
                  10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DO THE WORK!</h3>
                <p class="card-text padding-30">In order to become good at anything (especially basketball) you have to
                  put THAT work in. The more hours you put into practice, the better your results. Becoming a better
                  player does not happen instantly. You have to work hard every day, to get to achieve your level of
                  skill and fitness. There is no secret to your overall basketball improvement. It is the outcome of
                  preparation, hard work and learning from failure.<br><br>Done? Ok, good! Now start applying these tips
                  in your daily routine and basketball training. Also, don't ask me to pick a favourite tip because,
                  honestly, I can't! They are all VERY helpful tips!<br><br><br><strong>Until next
